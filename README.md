# **Java Projects Repository**

**Creator:** [neonite](https://github.com/neonite2217/)

This repository contains multiple Java-based projects, each organized into its own folder.
All projects are built using **OpenJDK** and include commands on how to compile and run them.

## **Project Structure**

Each project is located in its own subfolder within this repository. For example:

```
java-projects-repo/
├── AJavaProject/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── PayrollManagementSystem.java
│   └── ...
├── AnotherJavaProject/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── InventoryManagementSystem.java
│   └── ...
└── some otherJavaProject/
    ├── README.md
    ├── AnotherJavaProject.java
    └── ...
```

Each folder contains:
- A `README.md` file with details about the project.
- The `.java` source files.
- Any additional resources or dependencies required by the project.

## **Prerequisites**

Before running any project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: All projects are built using **OpenJDK 17** (or later). You can download it from [here](https://openjdk.org/).
- **Command Line Interface**: To compile and run the programs, you will need access to a terminal or command prompt.

Verify your Java installation by running:
```bash
java -version
```

## **How to Compile and Run**

To compile and run any project, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Navigate to the Project Directory**
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the project files.

```bash
cd path/to/your/project/folder
```

### **Step 2: Compile the Java Code**
Use the `javac` command to compile the main Java file.

```bash
javac MainFileName.java
```

*Replace `MainFileName.java` with the appropriate filename for the project.*

### **Step 3: Run the Compiled Program**
After successfully compiling the code, run the program using the `java` command.

```bash
java MainFileName
```

*Again, replace `MainFileName` with the name of your compiled class (without the `.java` extension).*

readme.md in each file contains the codes to be run in your terminal
(or IDE of choice)

## **Contributing**

This `README.md` file provides a simple overview of the repository and gives clear instructions on how to compile and run any Java project within it. You can customize it further if needed, but this should cover everything you asked for in a clean and minimalistic way.
